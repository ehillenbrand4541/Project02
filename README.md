[Project 02 Data Collection.ipynb] is the initial data collection and initial EDA notebook for this project. I used .xlsx files from hudexchange.info and census.gov websites. This notebook generates CSV files that are used in [Project 02 MVP 01.ipynb].

[Project 02 MVP 01.ipynb] is the second EDA notebook. It uses CSV files created by [Project 02 Data Collection.ipynb] and generates pickled dataframes that are used in Project 02 final EDA and final modeling.ipynb. Here is where I created my MVP.

[Project 02 final EDA and final modeling.ipynb] uses pickled dataframes generated by [Project 02 MVP 01.ipynb]. Here is where I came to the conclusion that the data I used, in the way that I used it, cannot beat the naive model.

All notebooks work best with the notebook extension "Table Of Contents 02" which allows you to collapse sections for ease of navigation.
